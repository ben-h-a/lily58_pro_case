# Lily58 gasket mount case

This is my first custom board and I wanted to create my own gasket mounted case for the lily

This is a fully parametric design (albeit with some slightly ropey parameter names). I have worked to remove instances of topological naming issues with freecad by basing the design of a single reference body, the top plate.

## Features
- Paremetric design
- Gasket mounted top plate
- parametric tenting (only supports pitch at the moment).
- usb-c connector instead of TRRS for safer hotswap.
